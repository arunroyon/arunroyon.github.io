# About Me

I am **Arun Roy**, a dedicated researcher and Postdoctoral Fellow at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics in Bangalore, India. I hold a PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics from CHRIST (Deemed to be University), where I specialized in studying the optical and infrared properties of Herbig Ae/Be stars and young stellar objects.

Over the past six years, my research has spanned a diverse range of topics—from investigating the kinematics of young stars and exploring the "Rocket effect" using Gaia astrometric data, to delving into the dynamics of stellar clusters and the processes of massive star formation. My work combines extensive astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic analyses, utilizing state-of-the-art facilities and instruments such as VLT/X-Shooter, CRIRES, Spitzer, JWST, and Gaia.

I have been fortunate to secure telescope time at renowned ground-based observatories including VBO, Kavalur, HCT Hanle, and DOT Devastal. My research contributions have been recognized through 14 publications in leading astronomy journals, reflecting a balanced mix of first-author and collaborative works.

In addition to my research, I am passionate about academic outreach and education. I have designed and delivered hands-on astronomy courses—such as "Introduction to Astropy" and "Astronomical Data Handling using Topcat and Python"—for both undergraduate and postgraduate students. Collaborating with institutions like TIFR, SN Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences, and ASIAA has enriched my perspective and strengthened my multidisciplinary approach.

My current projects include studying the formation and survival of fullerenes in young star-forming regions using archival Spitzer and JWST data, as well as contributing to collaborative efforts like the ACA cartography of Herbig stars at ESO. Through these endeavors, I continue to push the boundaries of astrophysical research while inspiring future generations of scientists.

Feel free to explore my academic achievements and research endeavors on this website. I look forward to connecting with fellow researchers and contributing to our collective understanding of the cosmos.
